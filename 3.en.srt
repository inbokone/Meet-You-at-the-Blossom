1
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,640
- Hold steadily.
- Got it.

2
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,720
- I've already wiped up there.
- Alright.

3
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,840
- Put it here.
- Be careful.

4
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,160
Give me a hand here.

5
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,680
I'm coming.

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
And here.

7
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,460
Put it here.

8
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,440
It's Zheng Huaien indeed.

9
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,636
He is the young leader of an escort
agency at the foot of Mount Jinqi.

10
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:14,137
Prince Shen hoodwinked the public,
and detained a shipment of their goods.

11
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,646
They knew that the common people
were no match for the government.

12
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:18,333
So they had to compromise in this way.

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,640
As I expected,
this Prince Shen is really evil!

14
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,054
Exactly. No wonder the Master said
there's not even one good official around.

15
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,780
Thank you, my Master. Thank you.

16
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,458
In that case, I have nothing
to worry about anymore.

17
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,040
- I don't have to...
- My Master.

18
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,440
I think something's wrong.

19
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,600
If that Mister Zheng and his family
come from an ordinary escort agency,

20
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,920
then why should the Master guard against them?

21
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,680
Besides, even Prince Su
has not heard about the news.

22
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,040
How could Zhang Chun have known so easily?

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,240
- Prince Su told us before he left...
- Prince Su, Prince Su.

24
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,480
Since you listen to him so much,
just follow him then.

25
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,870
No, my Master.

26
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,160
Since I was saved by you from
human traffickers when I was eight,

27
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,000
I swore that I would never
serve another master in my life.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
- The sun and moon can be my witnesses.
- Stop.

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,760
- Get out of here now if you don't shut up.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,320
Look, Zhang Chun has been
working for me for so many years.

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,120
He has never made any mistake, right?

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,380
That makes sense.

33
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,980
What did I want to say just now?

34
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,440
You said...

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,340
- Said what?
- You said...

36
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,240
Be careful.

37
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,120
Master, Young Master, My Lady,

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
the Young Lady is insisting on
going together with you.

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,720
I'm still worried about Xiaoyu.
Let me check on her.

40
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,760
Don't worry, Mother. I will handle it.

41
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
You two just go to the temple and pray.

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,920
That's right, darling.

43
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,720
You worry about Xiaoyu, but what about me?

44
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Business first.

45
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,280
All right.

46
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,960
Xiaobao. Talk to your sister then.

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,340
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

48
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
- Take care of your sister.
- I know.

49
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,260
Take care.

50
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:49,320
- Let me go!
- It's alright, my Lady. Don't cry.

51
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm going to find my parents.
I'm going to find my brother!

52
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,441
All right, all right.
Please calm down, my Lady.

53
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,400
No!

54
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
- Calm down, my Lady.
- Let me go!

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,000
My Lady...

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,048
I'm going to find my brother.

57
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:07,920
- My Lady...
- I'm going to find my brother.

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,360
Xiaoyu. What's wrong with you?

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,460
What's wrong?

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,480
It's alright. Stop crying.
You are breaking my heart.

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,140
Why don't you let me go with them, brother?
I also want to go to Xiyuan Temple to pray.

62
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,400
Alright, stop crying.

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,760
Look, my dear princess.

64
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,120
Don't be angry anymore. Okay?

65
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,580
Behave well.

66
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,320
[Xue Mansion]

67
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,140
Lianyu. Lianyu!

68
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,380
Butler Xu!

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,080
Lianyu!

70
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,240
Lianyu...

71
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,960
Lianyu. Lianyu!

72
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,760
Lianyu!

73
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,700
Lianyu!

74
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,280
Lianyu. Lianyu.

75
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,700
What happened?

76
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,380
Lianyu. Lianyu!

77
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,700
Lianyu...

78
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,840
Brother.

79
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,740
Sister.

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,100
Come here.

81
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,580
It's alright.

82
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
It's alright.

83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,260
Brother is here.

84
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,680
Xiaoyu. Your brother and parents are blessed.

85
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,680
You don't need to pray for blessings
any longer.

86
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,240
All you need to do is to stay in the house,
and grow up safely and happily.

87
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,880
I remember you said
you want to hang out, right?

88
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,900
I will set aside some time in a few days,
and take you out, okay?

89
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,360
By the way, the other day,
someone sent some stuff from the West.

90
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,540
Even the princesses in the palace
cannot get access to it.

91
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,720
How about it? Let's take a look, okay?

92
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
Okay!

93
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,820
Come on.

94
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,920
Let me tell you, Xiaoyu.

95
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,980
The stuff from the West is really interesting.

96
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,600
Brother. Who are those two people?

97
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,820
What are they doing in our house?

98
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,260
Do not act rashly.

99
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,520
How rude! Dogs indeed
behave like their masters.

100
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,320
None of them are good people.

101
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,960
My Master. My Master!

102
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,300
I found the medicine you asked for.

103
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,920
What's wrong with you, brother?

104
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,280
- Are you sick?
- Don't worry. It's for someone else.

105
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,840
Okay.

106
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,869
Let's go.

107
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
How sure are you about this?

108
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,480
It is really true.

109
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,640
After the Xues were murdered, the only thing
we didn't find was the girl's body.

110
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,080
But why did the Jins take her?

111
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,240
You guys go and check it out.
Don't tell my father yet.

112
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,040
Yes, sir.

113
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,300
How about the account book?

114
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,800
Surprisingly, Leader Jin is
not as stupid as the rumor says he is.

115
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,120
My Lord. Why don't we just kidnap Jin Xiaobao?

116
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,080
We can extort a confession from the Jins.
They love their son the most.

117
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,100
- They will surely give it to us.
- Youying.

118
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,040
The Jin Mansion is heavily guarded.

119
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
And Su Yin is quite a thoughtful person.

120
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,120
Before leaving, not only did he
leave a group of skilled fighters,

121
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,040
but he secretly arranged hidden guards
in Huaizhou and around the Jin Mansion.

122
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,200
Do you really think we'll be able to safely
leave Huaizhou after kidnapping Jin Xiaobao?

123
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,660
Besides, it will definitely alarm
Zongzheng Lihan.

124
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,760
They've sent to the Tongjiao Army*, right?
[The private army of the Second Prince]

125
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,860
Yes.

126
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,660
Look.

127
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,920
This is medicine for wounds
from Lingxi's tribute.

128
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,320
You were badly injured last time.
It hasn't healed, right?

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,480
Here you go.

130
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,060
Apply it now to avoid leaving a scar.

131
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,120
This medicine is good.
Apply it for three days and it will heal.

132
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,980
Don't be shy. Let me help you.

133
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,380
Huaien.

134
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,960
Huaien. You...

135
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,320
Don't be shy. I really like you, sincerely.

136
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,800
As a man, don't you have any sense of shame?

137
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,374
I am shameless?

138
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:08,220
You were quite shameless that day, too.

139
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,420
I dare you to say it again.

140
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,340
Huaien. Why do you smell so sweet?

141
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,201
Leader Jin. We have received
secret letters from several managers.

142
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:52,020
They said that the Second Prince
is going to plot a rebellion.

143
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,495
The knife hanging over the
head is finally going to fall.

144
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,060
Are we just going to sit here and do nothing?

145
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,040
Sit here and do nothing?

146
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,320
Then why did you think I would
summon you here today? For a meal?

147
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,820
I'm telling you...

148
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,820
Business first.

149
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,104
There's news from the imperial court.

150
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:35,320
The Emperor has sent Li Gongxiang to the south.

151
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,520
The purpose is to get the account book
of our Furun Chamber of Commerce.

152
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,760
That... That...

153
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,520
What?

154
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,380
What I mean is,
we can sit tight for the moment.

155
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,480
The money in that account book
still needs some time to be disclosed.

156
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
During this period, the Second Prince
won't take action openly for the time being.

157
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,278
The court has no evidence.

158
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,378
So he can't do anything to us.

159
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,520
No.

160
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,320
Li Gongxiang got to know Xue Wei
in his early years.

161
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,000
Will they use the Xue family
as an excuse to take action?

162
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,680
I knew that we shouldn't
have gotten rid of the Xues back then.

163
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,720
If we had not gotten rid of the Xues,
we would have been the ones who died.

164
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,760
- You...
- Hey.

165
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,480
Calm down.

166
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,700
My friends...

167
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,840
Second Prince controlled and manipulated us,
using us to make money for him.

168
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,760
As for the Xues,
they vacillated between the two,

169
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,720
and took our lives as leverage to
show their loyalty to the Emperor.

170
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,320
Since they were unkind to us first, they
can't blame us for our unrighteousness.

171
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,040
If they had not died, we would have died.

172
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,840
Everybody, we all have a wife,
children, and parents.

173
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,440
If we don't look out for ourselves, who will?

174
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,420
But the daughter of the Xues, she...

175
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,040
There's no any daughter of the Xues.

176
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,860
The Xues have been all murdered.
There were no survivors.

177
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,440
What are you doing here? Go back now.

178
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,200
- We are worried about you.
- Yes.

179
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,640
Just stand outside and wait for me.

180
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,921
If I'm in any danger,
I'll smash the cup to ask for help.

181
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,520
Beyond that, whatever sounds you hear,
do not come in.

182
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,620
But...

183
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,260
Okay. Let's go.

184
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,440
Did the Young Master cry just now?

185
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,280
Maybe not. I didn't hear it.

186
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,840
That may be my imagination.

187
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,380
I just wanted to come in and have a look
whether you have applied the medicine properly.

188
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,280
Jin Xiaobao. Do you know how to run a business?

189
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,840
Of course. Don't you know
what business my family runs?

190
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,080
How could I not understand it?

191
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,360
Do you have any knowledge
of your father's business?

192
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,280
Did he get you involved in it?

193
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,600
How are you feeling now? I found someone
to customize that muscle-softening powder.

194
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,280
All of my body is covered with it.

195
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,440
- What are you going to do?
- What am I going to do?

196
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,940
What do you think?

197
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm not like you. As cold as marble.

198
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,800
From now on, you are my man.

199
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,280
I'll treat you with the best food and drink,
and give you whatever you want.

200
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,560
I will never leave or forsake...

201
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,760
Why are there so many wounds?
Didn't I tell you to apply the medicine?

202
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,620
You are not a stone that won't hurt.

203
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,480
It's all my fault.
I knew you had wounds on your body,

204
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,972
but still asked you to pick him up yourself.

205
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,300
I didn't mean to.

206
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,720
Fortunately, the wounds are not very serious.

207
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,071
Just apply the medicine for
a few days and they will heal.

208
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
Wait.

209
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,800
You... Why do you still
have so many wounds?

210
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,220
Do you bodyguards
have to face so many dangers?

211
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,520
Huaien. Your heartbeat
is different from others.

212
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,800
It sounds nice.

213
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,420
What? You... How could you still move?

214
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,800
Do you really think I will be trapped by this?

215
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
But you just let me touch your body.

216
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,320
No, I... Let me go.

217
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,907
You still have wounds that haven't healed.

218
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:38,132
Please take care of yourself.

219
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,680
What are you doing?
Do I have thorns on my body?

220
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,920
Then last night, why did you...?

221
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,521
- Is that something worth showing off?
- I am not showing off, okay?

222
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,660
If it weren't for you...

223
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,500
What's wrong with you? You really...

224
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,060
This is my room. Why should I come out?

225
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:29,620
[Jin Mansion]

226
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,860
His heart was beating so fast.
He must have had feelings for me, too.

227
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,860
Why is he so handsome and beautiful?

228
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,300
He must like me.
Why else would he kiss me, right?

229
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,020
He just doesn't admit it yet.

230
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,393
The Young Master just said,
Mister Huaien likes him,

231
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:17,200
but just refuses to admit it.

232
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,800
That's impossible.

233
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,680
Do you think the Young Master is obsessed?

234
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,480
Mister Huaien...
He's such a cold-blooded guy.

235
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,920
There's nothing good about him
except for his appearance.

236
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,240
The point is that he's a man.

237
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,700
Why is the Young master so obsessed with him?

238
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,280
Do you think the Young Master is enchanted?

239
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,960
He's so powerful.

240
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,280
Such a large dose of muscle-softening
powder couldn't defeat him.

241
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,840
Do you remember what
Prince Su told us before he left?

242
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,440
Of course. Protect the Young Master.

243
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,320
Not this. What else?

244
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,619
You couldn't remember,
so you asked me, right?

245
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,240
I...

246
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,140
- Why am I...
- My Lord.

247
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,180
Come in.

248
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,800
My Lord. There's news from Zhang Chun.

249
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,200
Jin Xiaoyu is indeed Xue Lianqing.

250
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,320
On the day the Xues were murdered,
she was taken away by Jin Xiaobao.

251
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,520
Xue Lianyu, the eldest son of the Xues,
was close friends with Jin Xiaobao.

252
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,240
I heard that a few years ago at Yicui Building,
they met each other in a fight.

253
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,140
Since then, they had kept close contacts.

254
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,640
Yicui Building?

255
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,460
It's a brothel.

256
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,000
If Jin Xiaobao just rashly took her away,

257
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,720
it's impossible that Zongzheng Lihan
failed to check it out.

258
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,060
It's blocked by someone secretly.

259
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,866
It's Su Yin.

260
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,922
What's his relationship with the Jins?

261
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,920
Su Yin's father, Su Wentian, met the
leader of Jinqian Gang in his early years.

262
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,040
When Su Wentian was aspiring
to become the leader of Wulin,

263
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,600
the Jins offered him a lot of help.

264
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,200
Since then, the two families have
developed a close relationship.

265
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,040
Jin Xiaobao has known Su Yin since childhood.

266
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,480
They grew up together,
and have a really close friendship.

267
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,000
A close friendship?

268
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,660
I'd like to see how close their friendship is.

269
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,520
Tell my father.

270
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,662
Tell him that I'll get the account book
as soon as possible.

271
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:59,760
Let him inform Li Gongxiang
so that he can prepare in advance.

272
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,040
Yes, sir.

273
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,280
Do you get any more news about
the account book, my Lord?

274
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,320
Leader Jin goes to Xiyuan Temple
on the third day of every month,

275
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,102
to meet with the managers of
the Furun Chamber of Commerce.

276
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:14,200
I guess that meeting has to do
with the account book.

277
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,200
If that is the case, then the third day
of next month is the best time for us.

278
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,520
My Lord.
We have to prepare as early as possible.

279
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,720
No need to rush. Let me think.

280
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,560
My Lord. To get the account book,
we have been preparing for a year.

281
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,960
Now is exactly the time to finish the mission.
How could we not be in a hurry?

282
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,960
If we get in the way of the Lord's ambitions,
we cannot afford to bear the consequences.

283
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,700
Just because Jin Xiaobao, you can't...

284
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,440
Please forgive my rudeness.

285
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,680
My Lord. Jin Xiaobao is a man.

286
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,980
Even if he's a woman, you shouldn't
delay matters because of him, either.

287
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,600
You are already engaged.

288
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,700
Please calm down, my Lord.

289
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,160
To me, Jin Xiaobao is just a recreation.

290
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,720
I have my own plans.
Since when is it your turn to butt in?

291
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,400
- Get out.
- Yes, sir.

292
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,800
- My Lord.
- Come on.

293
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,640
Go.

294
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,320
Why did you stop me, brother?

295
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,160
If Jin Xiaobao is nothing important,
why can't we just act immediately?

296
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,706
What if we delay the matters of the Lord?

297
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,720
We are now taking orders from
the Young Lord, not the Lord.

298
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,280
Brother. You don't know what Jin Xiaobao
did to the Young Lord. He...

299
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,920
Anyway, Jin Xiaobao grew up in
a pot of money with a copper smell.

300
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,040
He's so coarse and vulgar, he's not even
qualified to carry shoes for the Young Lord.

301
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,400
What kind of witchcraft did Jin Xiaobao use?

302
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,840
We are now constrained everywhere.

303
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,160
That's not what we should care about.

304
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,040
We have to do what we are ordered to do.

305
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,520
Understand?

306
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,620
Come on.

307
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,420
It's so hot.

308
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,540
My throat hurts.

309
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,067
Zhaocai.

310
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,300
Jinbao.

311
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,260
Is there anyone?

312
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,820
There's a ghost. A ghost.

313
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,160
It's you.

314
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,440
What are you doing in my room at midnight?

315
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,800
What's wrong with you?

316
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,980
Nothing.

317
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,580
You have a fever.

318
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,900
There are assassins! Someone!

319
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Somebody! Catch him alive!

320
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,720
Hurry up!

321
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,820
Master.

322
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,760
- Master.
- Stop!

323
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,440
Master.

324
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,080
- My Master!
- Master!

325
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,180
Master.

326
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,980
My Master.

327
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,280
- My Lady.
- Oh no! The Master's illness is acting up!

328
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,040
Master.

329
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,920
My Master. My Master!

330
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,720
Master! Master...

331
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,880
- Catch them!
- Yes, sir!

332
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,080
Are you okay, my Master?

333
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,460
Master. Master...

334
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,240
My Master.

335
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,940
Where are they?

336
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,720
- My Master.
- My Master!

337
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,480
Somebody! Call the doctor now!

338
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,680
My Master.

339
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,920
Master. Master.

340
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,960
Wake up.

341
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,760
Brother. I found a secret room
in the room of Leader Jin.

342
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,920
The account book might be in there, we...

343
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Why did you act without authorization?

344
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,840
The account book has no clues so far.

345
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,240
And the deadline given by the Lord
is approaching.

346
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,040
By acting rashly and alarming the Jins?

347
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,157
Do you know how much trouble
it will bring to the Young Lord?

348
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,120
If you had gone with me,
we might have gotten the account book now.

349
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,180
Shut up.

350
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,500
Drink it.

351
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,660
I dare you to throw it up.

352
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,500
Is it that bitter?

353
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,039
Have a try yourself.

354
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,300
Here's still some in my mouth.
You can taste it.

355
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,480
How can you always be so shameless?

356
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,500
What about you?
Why do you do that to me again and again?

357
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,260
I am just into you.
So I want to be close to you all the time.

358
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,280
My Master. Wake up, my Master!

359
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,820
The Master is dying!

360
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,000
Master.

361
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,440
Father!

362
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,960
Father. What's wrong, Father?

363
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,480
What's wrong with you, Father?
Don't scare me, Father.

364
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,440
Someone, call the doctor, now!

365
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,160
I have sent someone to.

366
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,320
Father.

367
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,440
What are you doing?

368
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,500
Master.

369
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Father.

370
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,960
His chest is constricted. He cannot breath.

371
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,560
Let me clear it for him.

372
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,800
Let everyone get out of here.

373
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,560
- Open the doors and windows.
- Okay.

374
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,480
Everybody out.
Open all the doors and windows.

375
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,800
- Hurry up!
- Yes.

376
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,560
Let's go.

377
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,500
Don't worry, Mother.
