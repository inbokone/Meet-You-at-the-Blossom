1
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,640
Leader Jim's pulse is week and unstable.

2
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,480
I'll go back to make a prescription.
May I be excused?

3
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,920
Thanks to you last night.

4
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,960
Thank you very much.

5
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Last night, why were you so sad?

6
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,920
Life and death, fruits fall off when ripe,

7
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,040
they're nature.

8
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,880
Everyone will die eventually.

9
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,440
Even three-year-olds know it,
but why were you sad?

10
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,706
If, I mean, if your father dies,

11
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:42,600
will you remember him
or be sad for the rest of your life?

12
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,120
If, if my father dies...
God please ignore, it's just an assumption.

13
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm sure I'll be sad for the rest of my life,
and extremely heartbroken.

14
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,560
Although death is human nature,

15
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,200
but we live for emotions and desires.

16
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,560
Someone cares, then someone will be sad.

17
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,840
If your father dies,
would you remember him forever?

18
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
It's just an assumption.

19
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,760
I wouldn't.

20
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,120
You'll forget it after a long time.

21
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,080
It's just a sad thing
when you think about it.

22
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,040
After all, life is only a few decades,

23
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,830
if I spent all my time being miserable,

24
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,800
my father wouldn't be in peace after death.

25
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,680
But why

26
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,760
do some people remember someone's death

27
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,560
for ten or twenty years,
even for a lifetime.

28
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,640
Well, maybe the one died young or was
persecuted and did not have a good death.

29
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,760
In this case, it's really hard to let go.

30
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,200
If you get your revenge, then
you won't have to worry about it.

31
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,000
That's not necessarily the case.

32
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,960
Why? You know someone like that?

33
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
It's my father.

34
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,920
My father and my mother had been
in love with each other since childhood.

35
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,800
They promised each other for life.

36
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,480
But my uncle took away her by force.
Made my mother to be his concubine.

37
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
My father and mother had me through
a hidden connection before I was born.

38
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,280
Who are you?

39
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,080
My uncle's wife is afraid of
airing the family's dirty laundry,

40
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,560
she decided to execute me and my mother.

41
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,680
Tong En.

42
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,760
Tong En. Tong En.

43
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,400
Tong En. Tong En.

44
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,000
Tong En.

45
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,600
Tong En. Tong En.

46
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,120
My mother died saving my father.

47
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
After that, my father established
a separate household with me.

48
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,720
He swore to seek revenge for my mother.

49
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,520
My father only loved my mother.

50
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,685
From my young age, he often beat and scold me.

51
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:43,680
I had to obey him unquestioningly.
Or else I would suffer physical pain.

52
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,400
I was trying to complete
the task my father entrusted to me before that.

53
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
That's why I offended Prince Shen.

54
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,880
I see.

55
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,320
How could your father treat you like that?

56
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Don't worry.
If your father doesn't care for you, I will.

57
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,920
From now on, you are under my protection.

58
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,000
You will be able to walk with your head
held high in the four provinces of Jiangnan.

59
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
I, Jin Xiaobao, swear to heavens

60
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,560
that as long as I am around, I will never
let you suffer even a bit of grievance.

61
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,560
But,

62
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,200
as long as I don't complete the task,
I'm not free for a day.

63
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,960
What task? Tell me, I'll help you.

64
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,600
Forget about Prince Shen or any other prince,
it's no big deal.

65
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,360
Prince Shen is not to be feared.

66
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,880
It's just that I have one
more task to be done urgently.

67
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,920
What is it? Just tell me.

68
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,480
In this world, there is nothing
that cannot be done with money.

69
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,120
I, Jin Xiaobao have plenty of money.

70
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,040
- Your family...
- Young master, the master is awake.

71
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,960
Father. Father.

72
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
Father.

73
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,760
Father.

74
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
Xiaobao.

75
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,640
You've finally woken up.
Why did you get sick again?

76
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm fine.

77
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,360
Do we still have the pills that
the divine doctor gave previously?

78
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,560
Did you forget to take them on time again?

79
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,440
Young Master, there was
an assassin come in the house.

80
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,320
Assassin?

81
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,240
Did you catch the assassin?

82
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Master was sick, we were distracted,
so they managed to escape.

83
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,400
Unreasonable!

84
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,480
How dare they make trouble on my territory.
Are they tired of living?

85
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,520
I suspect that the assassin
is still in the mansion.

86
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,720
The only outsider here now is Mr. Huaien.

87
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,360
The prince instructed us before
he left to closely monitor him.

88
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,000
But his martial arts are strong and
his whereabouts are unpredictable.

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,080
It can't be him.

90
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,680
I had a high fever last night.

91
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,760
He took care of me all night
without leaving my side at all.

92
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,640
Moreover, last night he even used
his internal energy to heal father's injury.

93
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,040
If he was the assassin,
why would he go through all this trouble?

94
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,440
You had a high fever?
Xiaobao, what happened to you?

95
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Perhaps I caught a cold.

96
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,120
Mother, we should thank Huaien
for taking care of me last night.

97
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,320
Mother, Huaien may seem a bit cold.

98
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,440
He just seems difficult to get along with,
but deep down he is not a bad person.

99
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,880
Trust me.

100
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,160
Alright, I trust you,
but you need to take care of yourself.

101
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,280
Mr. Zhou, go and bring some hot water.

102
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,840
Master.

103
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,680
Young master, calm down.

104
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,840
Young master.
I found a secret room in Jin Bao's room.

105
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,160
I think there must be
something inside. We can...

106
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:29,440
Young Master, please spare his life.

107
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
Idiot.

108
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
Do you think that after your unnecessary actions

109
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,120
the Jin family will just leave the secret
room open waiting for you to enter?

110
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,920
Do you think the Jinqian Gang
only has reputation without real power?

111
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,640
The head of the Jins already
has suspicions about us.

112
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,960
Left Shadow.

113
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,320
Come up with a plan with Zhang Chun.
Find a scapegoat.

114
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,880
Yes sir.

115
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Xiaobao said that he's going to see Huaien.
I've asked Zhaocai and Jinbao to follow him.

116
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
- Mr. Zhuang.
- Yes.

117
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,360
Strengthen security in the backyard.

118
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
No unauthorized personnel are allowed in.

119
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,960
Yes sir.

120
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,800
Don't worry. The account books are safe.

121
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,240
You were in critical condition last night.

122
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
Thanks to Huaien's timely help.

123
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,080
Moreover, he has been
taking good care of Xiaobao.

124
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,480
I think he is not the assassin.

125
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,520
Take a look at these calligraphy and painting.

126
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,640
Please take a look.

127
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,760
Things are hidden in Jin's house.

128
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,000
Is that true?

129
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,080
Enjoy your meal sir.

130
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,040
Is this true?

131
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,200
Does the Jin family
really have ancient lost martial arts manuals?

132
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,760
Absolutely true!

133
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,680
Let's come up with a plan
to sneak into their house.

134
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,280
Yes.

135
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,920
If we obtain these manuals, then
we will be invincible!

136
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,800
Yes, yes!

137
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Who is there?

138
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,880
Are you okay?

139
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,800
Why do these assassins keep coming endlessly?

140
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,280
I can't tell what sect they belong too.
They are all new faces.

141
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
- Here too.
- Okay.

142
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,760
Let's go.

143
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,080
Father.

144
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,400
Last night thanks to Huai'en arriving on time,
otherwise you might not have seen me again.

145
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,240
We must thank him properly then.

146
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,960
Of course.

147
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,920
But, Father, what is happening
recently in our house?

148
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,880
Why are there so many assassins
appearing one after another?

149
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,178
Well, our family business is growing big,

150
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,560
so it's inevitable that we'll be
victimized by the bad people.

151
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,440
In any case you must
protect yourself, understand?

152
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,800
Yes.

153
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,240
In just a blink of an eye,
our Xiaobao will be 20-years-old soon.

154
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,000
In near future, our Jin family
will rely on you to carry forward.

155
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,160
- Is that right, my lady?
- Yes.

156
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,360
Father, I am still not grown up yet though!

157
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,400
You will surely live long and healthy.
So does mother.

158
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,640
Good!

159
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,960
Master!

160
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,920
Father!

161
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,520
I'm fine.

162
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,400
Thank you.

163
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,320
Three feet of ice wasn't built in a day.
Forgive me for being unable to help.

164
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Even you can't do anything about it?

165
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
Young master.

166
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,080
Li Gongxiang has been ordered
by the emperor to rush to Huaizhou.

167
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,840
The crown prince is accompanying him
with a large number of imperial secret guards.

168
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,400
Our master ordered us to immediately
return the roster without delay.

169
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
The matter of the Jin family's account books
can be discussed later.

170
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,920
Tell Zhang Chun to come see me.

171
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,440
Yes sir.

172
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,560
Zhang Chun, I heard you have
a way to cure my father's illness.

173
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,360
Young Master Jin, have you heard of Que Siming?

174
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,440
Who?

175
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
He is the 18th generation descendant of the Que family.

176
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,480
It said that there is no sickness
in this world that he cannot cure.

177
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,400
- Really?
- Yes.

178
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,440
Then where is he?
I will send someone to invite him immediately.

179
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,785
As long as he can cure my father's illness,

180
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,280
all the money and precious metals
in Jiangnan's four provinces

181
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
will be at his disposal as he wishes.

182
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,960
This person has a peculiar temperament
and extremely strict conditions for diagnosis.

183
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,760
He does not charge
those destined for treatment,

184
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,444
but for those who are not destined,
even wealth cannot entice him.

185
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,560
So, how can one be considered
destined to see him?

186
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,120
In my humble opinion,

187
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,200
one must be sincere and devoted for fate
to open up golden stones.

188
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,520
Can you say something I can understand?

189
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,920
I have learned that this person is
currently wandering around Yuxia.

190
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,080
Why don't you personally invite him?

191
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,440
Perhaps with your filial piety, the divine
doctor may be moved by your sincerity.

192
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,720
Jin Xiaobao. What are you up to again?

193
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Well,

194
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,680
this headband was made by
a master from Jinxiu Pavilion.

195
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,520
It looks exactly like mine.
They're a matching pair.

196
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,880
How about it? It looks good right?

197
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,480
I'll give it to you.

198
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
Well...

199
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,680
I want you continue accompanying
me on another trip Yuxia. Can you?

200
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,680
I want find a divine doctor for my father
but he surely won't let me go.

201
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,000
Zhao Cai and Jin Bao only obey my father,
I can't command them.

202
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
So, you go with me. Is it okay?

203
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,720
Why should I go with you?

204
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,400
You are skilled in martial arts
so you could protect me.

205
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,880
Who knows how dangerous this journey could be!

206
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,360
What is it?
We are already in that kind of relationship.

207
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,160
You won't even help out with such small favor？

208
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,760
What relationship do we have?

209
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,480
You... No... What's wrong with you?

210
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,880
Say this again?

211
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,040
If we are not in that kind of relationship,
why did you treat me that way a few days ago?

212
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,920
Taking care of me, saving my father,
aren't you busy?

213
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,120
I just needed to lift a finger.

214
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,720
What... Why are you like this?

215
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,640
You're being hot and cold with me,
are you possessed?

216
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,080
If you don't want to go then don't go.
Who cares?

217
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,760
If you don't go, and your father comes to
look for you again, I won't help you at all.

218
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,520
I knew you couldn't put me in danger.

219
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,840
Let's go.

220
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,660
Is this an elopement?

221
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,420
You promised to help me deal with my father.

222
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,659
In exchange for that,
I will accompany you to Yuxia.

223
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:04,840
Yeah!

224
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,680
When we come back from Yuxia, I will give you
the moon if that's what you want.

225
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,920
Huaien, wait for me.

226
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,720
Huaien! What are you doing?

227
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,042
Stop! Huaien, don't throw away my stuff.

228
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:25,240
This is a sleeping aid.

229
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,737
This is because I am afraid that
the food outside may not be easily digested.

230
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,137
My Bi Luo Chun tea!

231
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:34,520
Huaien! These things are all useful please.

232
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,760
Please, please!

233
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,400
Martial arts manuals?

234
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:54,792
How did they come up with this idea?

235
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,125
Mr. Zhuang. Did you find
the source of this information?

236
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:03,910
It spread overnight in the city.
It's hard to trace back.

237
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,880
It seems someone deliberately did it.

238
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:12,591
Master.

239
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,600
Master. There's news from the waterway.

240
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,960
Li Gongxiang and his group will arrive
at Huaizhou in less than three days.

241
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,200
Could it be a ploy by the court side
to leverage on this situation?

242
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,840
Whether it's court or the Tongjiao Army...

243
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,040
They are in the dark while
we are under the light.

244
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,880
At present, only protecting these
account books can give us a glimmer of hope.

245
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,160
Yes.

246
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,760
Master.

247
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,080
Young master has left a note and gone away.

248
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,880
Damn it!

249
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,360
How can anyone live in such a place?

250
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:44,264
Just a small wound, nothing serious.

251
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:45,664
What...

252
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,360
What are you doing?

253
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,760
I wanted to give you some clothes. You
dressed so lightly, aren't feeling cold at all?

254
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,880
What kind of technique is this?
It's quite warm now.

255
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,200
Oh you, I think I've figured out now,
you're tough on outside but soft inside.

256
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,160
So beautiful!

257
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,760
Look at her!

258
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,440
Good!

259
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,040
Very good!

260
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
That's nice.

261
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
Come and look at this.

262
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,760
These vegetables! Fresh vegetables!

263
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,480
Take a look! Come here, girl.

264
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,160
That's nice.

265
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,440
Calligraphy and painting!
Take a look at calligraphy and painting!

266
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,960
They are all masterpieces!

267
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,800
I just think this restaurant is really nice.

268
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,400
We can finally stay at a nice place tonight.

269
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,440
The bed was too hard last night.

270
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,520
I'm just worried about your waist.
Does your waist hurt?

271
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,120
Waist hurt?

272
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,960
Come on, let's go.

273
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,320
I'm thirsty.

274
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,120
Pour me a glass of water.

275
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,400
Hey, you! What do you mean by that?

276
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,440
Don't you know how to pour it yourself?

277
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
But I'm so tired.

278
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,240
Besides, we already have
that kind of relationship.

279
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
Aren't you even willing to
pour me a glass of water?

280
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,080
What kind of relationship do we have?

281
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,360
You... Why are you talking like this again?

282
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,760
Zheng Huaien.
What exactly do you mean?

283
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,120
Why do you always change
your attitude towards me?

284
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,160
We must clear things up today.
Do you like me or not?

285
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,280
Like you?

286
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,800
You... You... You unfaithful man!

287
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,280
Why do you... Why do you
do this to me when you don't like me?

288
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,640
I'm the young master of Jinqian Gang,
why are you mocking me?

289
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,440
Go away.

290
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,770
We're both men. What's all this
about liking or not liking each other?

291
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,980
What's wrong with it?
How can men be different?

292
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,120
I like you, isn't that enough?

293
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,680
But my father...

294
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,760
He had been in love with
my mother for ten years.

295
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,840
Even if they were never together.

296
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,560
Except my mother,
he didn't care about anything or anyone else.

297
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,400
Not even himself

298
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,865
or me.

299
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:16,780
I really don't understand what the use
of this kind of love. Do you get it?

300
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,180
Not that.

301
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,560
No. This is not the same.

302
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,280
What's the difference?

303
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,840
I really don't know what love is
but I can promise one thing.

304
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,000
I won't treat others as I did to you.

305
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,720
If there is someone I truly want to love,

306
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,520
it would only be you. Is it okay?

307
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,920
Really?

308
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,160
Yes.

309
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,360
It's okay if you don't know what love is.
I can teach you.

310
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,880
It's different from your parents.

311
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,520
First of all, you can't push me away.

312
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,560
Remember, you were born to
redeem yourself for your mother's sake.

313
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,720
Don't harbor unworthy thoughts
for anyone or anything. Understand?

314
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,600
Don't even think of trying to escape.

315
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,800
No matter where on earth,
you can't escape from my grasp.

316
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,040
Huaien.

317
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,760
Huaien. What are you thinking?

318
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,200
You must never lie to me.

319
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,800
Okay.

320
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,040
It's fine, just drink some water.

321
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,400
How dare you!

322
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,440
Let's go.

323
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,120
Well, Huaien. When we
return to Huaizhou this time,

324
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,240
I'll tell my father that
you helped me find the divine doctor.

325
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,520
And then, I'll tell him about us.

326
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,000
My father... He may not accept us,

327
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,800
but at least he won't hurt us.

328
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,280
And then, I'll cry and create
a scene with my mother.

329
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,080
That should settle half our issue.
How does that sound?

330
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,920
The food here isn't bad at all

331
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,360
Huaien. You should have some too.

332
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,840
They need help over there. Let's go.

333
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,680
Mr. Zhuang. Let me out!

334
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,040
- Get back inside!
- Let me out!

335
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,000
- My little lady!
- No. Let me out!

336
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,880
- I'm going to find brother Xiaobao.
- Behave!

337
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,400
- Let's go inside.
- Let me out!

338
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,960
Be obedient! Behave!

339
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,120
I never expected to find
a cave in this remote place.

340
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,080
The outside of the cave looks ordinary,
but inside, it looks great.

341
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,160
Huaien, how did you find such a good place?

342
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,680
Take off these wet clothes quickly.

343
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,000
Look at you. The weather is cold,
you should've be more careful.

344
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,560
These... these are all from your father?

345
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,880
He... How could he do this?

346
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,440
Is he really your biological father?

347
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,540
These are just external injuries.
Nothing serious.

348
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,520
How can these be just external injuries?
If it wasn't for bone-deep wounds,

349
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,493
how could they still be here?

350
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:19,178
It doesn't matter.
He may not even be able to beat me now.

351
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Speaking of which, I should thank him for this.

352
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:35,800
When we return to Huai Zhou, I'll have
Zhang Chun to get the best medicine for you.

353
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,320
And as for you, why don't you just forget
about finding your bad father anymore?

354
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,240
I'll protect you from now on.
How about that?

355
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,040
If he dares come looking for you again.

356
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,160
I will... I... I'll ask my father to give
him millions of money to send him away.

357
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,400
This is also a form of love, isn't it?

358
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,560
Do you really want to be with me forever?

359
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,240
Of course!

360
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,800
Although I was quite flirtatious before
meeting you, ever since I met you...

361
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,160
I only have you in my heart.

362
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,560
Today's incident doesn't count.

363
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,920
Neither does the dancer two days ago.

364
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,720
Everyone has their own desires
for beauty right? I was just looking.

365
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,360
Jin Xiaobao, you listen to me.

366
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,760
If you truly wish to stay with me forever,
there can't be any turning back afterwards.

367
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,720
From now on, there can't
even be thoughts about others.

368
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,720
From then on, whether it's heaven or hell,

369
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,680
you can only have me.

370
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,640
Is that okay for you?

371
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,120
Not even a glance?

372
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,520
Not at all!

373
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,320
Well, then I... I'll do my best.

374
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,980
I can do it! You can trust me.

375
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,320
Who is it? Come out!

376
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,420
Who is there? Who is it? Come out!
